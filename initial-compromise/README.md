# APT Initial Compromise

This directory contains examples of the initial compromise phase of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack.

## Overview

The initial compromise phase often involves social engineering techniques, such as phishing, to trick users into executing malicious payloads.

## Files

- `phishing-email.html`: A simulated phishing email designed to deceive users.
- `malicious-attachment.exe`: A dummy executable file that represents a malicious payload (for demonstration purposes only).

## How to Use

1. **Phishing Email**: Open `phishing-email.html` in a web browser to view the simulated phishing email.
2. **Malicious Attachment**: Be aware that `malicious-attachment.exe` is a dummy file and should not be executed.

> **Important**: This is for educational use only. Do not attempt to use these techniques maliciously.
